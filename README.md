# Prediction-of-Salary
Prediction of salary based on yr of experience using different machine learning tools, libraries, frameworks, etc.

In this code, 90% of data is used to train the machine and the remaining 10% data is used to predict the salary of an employee.
Any editor is fine to write this code (I have used Spyder)

You can also create your own CSV file, import it to the program and get the required output.

Feel free to contact me in case of any help.
